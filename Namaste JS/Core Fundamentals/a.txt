Array 
let a = []

a.length // counts the length of arr
a.push("value") // adds at the end
a.unshift("value") // adds in front of the array
a.pop() //removes from end
a.shift() // removes from the start

[
a.splice(1param, 2param, 3 params)  // to remove something from the middle - Updates the og array
takes 3 params - 1 and 2 are index, 1st is the index from where we begin deletion. 
2nd Param = Number of items to delete.
3rd param is the values that we add in place of the deleted values.
a.splice(2,4) // will delete from 2nd index and will delete 4 items from 2nd index and will modify a.

let array = ['today', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'great'];
array.splice(2, 2); //array would have the value ['today', 'was', 'great'].
]
[
a.slice() // slice behaves just like splice but it doesnt update the OG array. It takes the value to new array
takes 2 params -> (param1 , param2 )
param1 = from where to start deletion/extraction
param2=  where to stop deletion/extraction - but will not include this.
a.slice(2,4) // will remove from 2nd index just before 4th index. 

let weatherConditions = ['rain', 'snow', 'sleet', 'hail', 'clear'];
let todaysWeather = weatherConditions.slice(1, 3);  // ['snow', 'sleet']
]

...Spread Operator-> Copies the whole array to another array. (DEEP Copy)
